# 13. Usage Tips and Best Practices

Guidelines for getting the most out of Eduvance Bot in your server.

---

## Initial Setup

### Set Up Logging First

> [!TIP]
>
> Set your log channel first so every action is tracked from day one.

Configure your moderation log channel immediately after adding the bot to ensure all actions are properly recorded.

---

## Moderation Workflow

### Use a Progressive Ladder

Follow a consistent escalation path for moderation:

1. **Start with `/warn`** – For minor infractions
2. **Escalate to `/finalwarning`** – For repeated or more serious issues
3. **Apply `/punish`** – For violations that require immediate action
4. **Use `/ban`** – As a last resort for severe violations

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Use a "ladder": start with `/warn`, then `/finalwarning`, then `/punish` for consistency with your rulebook.

## Reputation System

### Enable and Promote Braincells

1. **Enable the system** – Use `/setup` or `/togglerep` to enable Braincells
2. **Educate members** – Explain how `/giverep` works and encourage positive behavior
3. **Showcase leaders** – Promote `/repleaderboard` to create friendly competition
4. **Reward contributions** – Use `/repmodify` for special events or outstanding contributions

> [!TIP]
>
> Enable Braincells and promote `/rep`, `/giverep`, and `/repleaderboard` to encourage positive behavior.

## Regular Review

### Monitor Server Health

Regularly review moderation data to understand your server:

- **Use `/modlog`** – Review individual member histories before making decisions
- **Check `/statistics`** – Understand overall server activity and moderation patterns
- **Analyze patterns** – Look for trends in warnings and violations

> [!TIP]
>
> Regularly review `/modlog` and `/statistics` to understand behavior patterns and server hotspots.

## Educational Resources

### Promote Past Paper Search

Make the past paper feature easily accessible:

- **Pin instructions** – Create a pinned message in student channels explaining `/pastpaper`
- **Quick access** – Consider creating a dedicated channel for educational resources
- **Share examples** – Show members how to use the command effectively

> [!TIP]
>
> Promote `/pastpaper` in student channels so members can quickly fetch Edexcel papers for revision.

## Configuration Management

### Keep Settings Updated

- **Review `/config`** – Periodically check your server configuration
- **Update roles** – Keep moderator roles and milestone roles current
- **Adjust channels** – Update log channels if your server structure changes

## Command Organization

### Categorize by Use Case

Organize your documentation and help system by:

- **Moderation** – Ban, kick, timeout, channel management
- **Warnings** – Warning system and final warnings
- **Punishments** – Violation-based punishment system
- **History** – Mod logs, statistics, user info
- **Reputation** – Braincells system
- **Utilities** – Help, about, past papers

---

## Error Prevention

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Missing permissions** – Ensure bot has necessary permissions in all channels
2. **Unconfigured logs** – Set up log channels before heavy moderation use
3. **Inconsistent escalation** – Follow your established moderation ladder
4. **Ignoring final warnings** – Take final warnings seriously in your decision-making
