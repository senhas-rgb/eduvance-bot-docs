# 12. Logging System

Eduvance automatically logs important events to your configured log channels.

---

## Overview

The logging system ensures transparency and accountability for all moderation actions and important events in your server.

---

## What Gets Logged

### Moderation Actions

All moderation actions are logged to the main moderation log channel:

- **Bans** – with reason, moderator, timestamp, and message deletion info
- **Unbans** – with reason, moderator, and timestamp
- **Kicks** – with reason, moderator, and timestamp
- **Warnings** – with warning ID, reason, moderator, and timestamp
- **Final Warnings** – with detailed information and consequences
- **Timeouts** – with duration, reason, moderator, and timestamp
- **Punishments** – with violation type, punishment applied, and full details
- **Channel Actions** – locks, unlocks, slowmode changes, and bulk deletions

### Reputation Changes

When a rep log channel is configured, the following are logged:

- **Reputation Given** – member-to-member rep transactions
- **Reputation Modified** – staff manual adjustments with reason

### Configuration Changes

All configuration changes made via setup/config commands are logged:

- Mod role changes
- Log channel updates
- Reputation system toggles
- Milestone role configurations

## Setting Up Logging

### Main Moderation Log Channel

Set the main moderation log channel using:

```discord filename="Discord" copy
/setlogchannel <channel>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> This command requires administrator permissions.

> [!TIP]
>
> Set your log channel first so every action is tracked from day one.

### Reputation Log Channel

Configure the reputation log channel during `/setup` or via `/config`:

- Used specifically for Braincells reputation transactions
- Can be the same as the main log channel or a separate channel
- Helps track community engagement and positive behavior

---

## Log Format

Logs include comprehensive information:

- **Action Type** – what happened (ban, warn, etc.)
- **Target User** – who was affected
- **Moderator** – who performed the action
- **Reason** – why the action was taken
- **Timestamp** – when it occurred
- **Additional Context** – relevant details (duration, warning ID, etc.)

---

## Best Practices

1. **Set up logging immediately** – Configure your log channels during initial setup
2. **Use separate channels** – Consider separate channels for moderation and reputation logs
3. **Review regularly** – Check logs periodically to understand server activity patterns
4. **Protect log channels** – Restrict access to log channels to trusted staff members
5. **Archive logs** – Consider using Discord's built-in logging or external tools for long-term storage

---

## Example Log Channels

- **Moderation Log:** `#mod-logs` – All moderation actions
- **Reputation Log:** `#rep-logs` – Braincells transactions
- **General Log:** `#server-logs` – Combined logging (if preferred)

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can use the same channel for both moderation and reputation logs if you prefer a single unified log.
