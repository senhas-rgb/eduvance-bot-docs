# 2. Getting Started

Eduvance Bot is designed for academic / community servers that need structured moderation, reputation tracking, and easy access to Edexcel past papers.
The bot uses Discord slash commands for all actions, logs all key events, and stores moderation and warning data in a database for long-term tracking.

## 2.1 Initial Setup `/setup`

```discord filename="Discord" copy
/setup
```

> [!TIP]
